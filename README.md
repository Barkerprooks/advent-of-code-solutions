# Advent of Code Solutions
Each day will be in a different language
## Days Complete
```
[x] day 1 - Haskell
[x] day 2 - Python
[X] day 3 - C
[X] day 4 - Rust
[X] day 5 - Ruby
```
- So far Rust appears to be the most ~~verbose~~ _safe_ language. But maybe I just don't know how to use it yet.
- Haskell gave me the most trouble despite it being the first day. Functional is hard. -.-
- C is great, I love C, I don't care how easy it is to shoot yourself in the foot, I'll always go back to it.
- Python is pretty great too, Keep in mind I've used Python almost more than C, my Python solution could've been cleaner.
- I'm almost tempted to say that Ruby is like a better Python. There's a lot of cool features that makes code shorter to write.
